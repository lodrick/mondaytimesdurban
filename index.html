                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Loren Ipsum has been the industry's 
                        standard dummy text ever since the 1550s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scambled it to
                        make a type specimen book. It has survived not onl five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of letraset sheets containing
                        Lorem Ipsum passages,a nd more recently with destop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                        versions of Lorem Ipsum Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an academic setting
                        and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, the idea of the webwas to link directly from one academic page
                        to another academic page. This was completely revolutionary idea in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the 
                        best a link could be made was to cite a reference in the midst of a type written paper and name that reference either
                        at the bottom of the page or on the last page of the academic paper. When it was possible for any person to write
                        and own a Mosaic page, the concept of a "home page" blurred the idea of page.[2] It was possible for anyone to
                        own a "Web page" or a "home page" which in many cases the website contained many physical pages in spite of
                        being called "a page". People often cited their "home page" to provide credentials, links to anything that a person
                        supported, or any other individual content a person wanted to publish.
